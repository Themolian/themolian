## Hey there, I'm Jamie!

I'm a Web Developer who's been in the game for 7 years, working at a handful of digital agencies which has given me a broad skillset to draw from on any given project. My main focus has been on CMS Integration, accessibility, and building the best experiences possible not just for the end user of a website, but for the people building and putting content into it as well.

In my everyday life, a Dad to a beautiful 2 year old girl, and a very colourful and quirky 9 year old parrot! I am joined in this journey by my best friend and wife (The same person!) whom I have practically grown up with.

## My bread and butter 🍞🧈
My specialties generally lie in the following areas:
- CMS Content Modelling / Template Architecture - Building webpages that follow a logical and easy-to-read structure on the front-end, and editing experiences that are intuitive and easy to grasp.
- Data Migration - Translating data between different CMSes
- Building accessible websites, maintaining semantic HTML and optimizing the user experience for every site visitor.
  

## The arrows in my quiver 🏹 (Tech Stack)

## Hosting with the Mosting 🌐

CRMs: Basecamp, JIRA, Trello, Monday.com, Salesforce
Comms: Slack, Discord


## On the OutsIDE (What I get up to outside of work)

- Climbing 🧗: I recently started what I can see developing into a long-lasting love affair with climbing as a hobby! I currently climb twice a month and already have a YouTube recommended filled with climbing-related videos 🙈
- Knitting 🧶: Being someone with AuDHD, getting into knitting recently has been a game changer. It's something creative I can do with my hands during wind-down time and has single-handedly contributed to making my sleep schedule reasonable again!
- Baking 🍰: I love food and have a prominent sweet tooth, that combined with the fact that I'm a tinkerer at heart has made baking something I love to do when I get the opportunity. My specialties are currently chocolate orange brookies and vegan cookies 🍪
- Photography 📸: I've been peripherally interested in photography ever since I got my first camera phone, but I have recently taken the plunge and bought my first professional ***✨camera✨*** which I have been loving learning more about the finer points of over the past couple of years
- Languages 💬: Curiosity is my primary vice, and nowhere is this more evident in my pursuit of learning new languages. The primary two languages I have been learning have been Japanese 🇯🇵 and Norwegian 🇳🇴 both of which have given me a wide appreciation for different cultures, and a lovely collection of stories and memories from my time using these languages in their mother countries! I have also recently re-booted my civic duty of learning my own mother tongue 🇮🇪, having only learned a smattering of words in school and am thoroughly enjoying the experience this time around.
